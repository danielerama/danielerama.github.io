## About me

Hi all! 

I am Daniele Rama, Postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Turin](https://www.unito.it/), working with Prof. [Rossano Schifanella](http://www.di.unito.it/~schifane/). My research leverages methods from complex systems analysis and computational social science to study online user behaviors relying on large-scale digital data scources.

Previously, I was a PhD student in [Modeling and Data Science](https://dottorato-mds.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) at the Dept. of Computer Science of the [University of Turin](https://www.unito.it/). During my doctoral studies, I have also been a [Research collaborator](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Research/Formal_collaborations) at the Wikimedia Foundation, and visited the [dlab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) @EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) advised by Prof. Robert West. Before joining academia, I worked as a Junior Researcher at the [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it/en/home) in Turin.

My background is in Physics of complex systems, which I studied in Turin and Trento.
