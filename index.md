## About me

Hi! I am a **PhD student** in **[Modeling and Data Science](https://dottorato-mds.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl)** at the [University of Turin](https://www.unito.it/) advised by Prof. [Rossano Schifanella](http://www.di.unito.it/~schifane/). My research leverages methods from complex systems analysis and computational social science to study online user behaviors relying on large-scale digital data scources. 

Previously, I spent one year at the ISI foundation awarded with a [Lagrange scholarship](https://www.isi.it/en/lagrange-project/scholarships) working on a data-for-good project. Before that, I received my master degree in Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Turin and my bachelor degree in Physics from the University of Trento.
